To use:

Step 1: Download all house of commons debates (full day transcripts) from Hansard as HTML web pages and save in a single location. Use a naming system that can be easily referenced, such as YYYMMDD of the transcript.

Step 2: Open 2a, converter. Ensure links to all HTML files are included in cells B2:Bx. Open the macro and change the i values to reflect the count of files to be converted. Click run. Save.

        Open 2b, processor. Copy all tabs from 2a, converter into the processor (ideally at the end). In N:10 to N:x of the control tab, enter all of the tab names (ideally YYYMMDD) pasted from the converter. Click Run. Open the Dashboard tab and input the YYYYMMDD names across Row 1, twice for each. The contributions and parliamentarian names should appear.

Step 3: Open Sitting Identification and paste in the dashboard output from 2b. Enter lookups, such as key reference terms, into the lookups tab - example railway terms appear currently. The lookups will identify when certain words were spoken in parliament, thus identifying a relevant debate to the research. If more than 98 lookups, modify the formulae in the 'Process' tab. Enter the YYYYMMDD list into the Results tab and extend formulae. This will show the number of references including reference terms, the more that occur the more relevant a days debating is for study.

Step 4: Copy Output tab from Step 3 into Ref term list for the Debate Identification. Utilise filters, formatting etc to make clear when contributions use rail reference terms. Identify how many references in a cluster are needed to consider the debate relevant. The next bit is quite manual. Use Hansard to find "debates" that include references being sought for research that are part of a relevant cluster. Download these debates.

Debate HTML files downloaded after Step 4 can be run through Steps 1 and 2 to be organised for further research.
